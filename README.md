# Bummer Engine

This is a simple 2D game engine written in C++ using SDL2. It is designed to be simple and easy to use, and is intended for use in game jams and other small projects.

## Installation
The engine comes with a simple `build.sh` script that uses `vcpkg` to install the required dependencies. To build the engine, run the following commands:

```bash
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```
This will create a `build` directory containing the compiled binary: `BummerEngine`.
Execute the binary to run the engine.
